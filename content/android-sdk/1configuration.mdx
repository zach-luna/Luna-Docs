# Configuration

## Init the sdk

In order to use the sdk you need to initialize it

Start by importing the library

```
import io.lunamedia.lunasdk.LunaSDK
```

The SDK main class is a singleton thread safe instance you can call, to init call

```
LunaSDK.init()
```

The init function accepts 2 parameters:
`context: Context` and `listener: SdkInitializationListener`

the listener will invoke methods according to the SDK status and allow to implement a method `onInitializationComplete` which will be called when the sdk finish init and return either error or success.

See implementation of sdk init and implementing the listener:

```
LunaSDK.init(this, object : SdkInitializationListener {
    override fun onInitializationComplete(error: Error?) {
        runOnUiThread {
            if (error == null) {
                log("LunaMedia SDK successfully initialized.")
            } else {
                log("LunaMedia SDK initialization failed with error: " + error.message)
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Once the success is being called the SDK is ready to load ads.
