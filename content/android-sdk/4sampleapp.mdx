# Sample App

In order to help our users to implement the SDK we came up with a Sample app that implements both Sdk and Mediation adapter and demonstrate the capabilities and usage of the SDK.

The sample repository can be found [Here](https://github.com/zach-luna/LunaSDK-Android-Sample)

Important: change AppLovin api key in the `MainActivity.kt` file.

```
val YOUR_SDK_KEY = "APPLOVIN_API_KEY"
```

## App Content

The sample app contains two modules (apps)

1. LunaSDK implementation - `sdk-sample`
2. AppLovin Luna SDK implementation using the adapter. - `sdk-sample-applovin-mediation`

feel free to run them and play with them in order to test your integration.
